#### 从基于统计模型到数据驱动式算法的演变

At the same time, a novel research area, based on data driven empirical algorithms, has been systematically growing in parallel to the well-founded mathematical models that are based on macroscopic and microscopic theories of traffic flow (Wang and Papageorgiou, 2005; Yuan et al., 2012; Treiber and Kesting, 2012; Fowe and Chan, 2013; Kerner et al., 2013). This significant leap from analytical to data driven modeling has been marked by an overwhelming increase of Computational Intelligence (CI) – Data Mining (DM) approaches to analyzing the data. Researchers have moved from what can be considered as a classical statistical perspective (the ARIMA Family of models), to Neural and evolutionary computational approaches (Karlaftis and Vlahogianni, 2011)

#### 目前的研究局限

Short-term traffic forecasting based on data driven methods is one of the most dynamic and developing research arenas with enormous published literature. Interestingly, however, **most of the research has concentrated on ‘testing’ alternative modeling approaches on short-term traffic data**, possibly **because of the data’s ready availability and the relative ease of applying many of the available analytical approaches.** This concentration leaves a number of important questions and challenges unaddressed or, relatively to the rest of the literature, under researched.
